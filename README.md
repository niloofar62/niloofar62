## 🛠️ My Projects
Here are a few projects I've been working on:

### Operation Gamification : **[Front End & Back end](https://github.com/niloofar62/operation-gamification-?tab=readme-ov-file)** | **[Live Site](https://operation-gamification.netlify.app/)**
- #### Tech stack : JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Google Sheets API, Google Forms, GitHub, Netlify
- This application simulates employee contests, focusing on the "Queen of Housekeeping Challenge." It serves as a digital bulletin board with pre-made designs, displayed on a TV or projector. The app includes an admin page and a game board, enabling managers to run employee contests at scale.


### Inspiration Board : **[Front End](https://github.com/niloofar62/front-end-inspiration-board)** | **[Back End](https://github.com/niloofar62/back-end-inspiration-board)**
- #### **Tech stack:** Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, React, Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS
-  Worked collaboratively in a 3-person team to design and build an interactive web application that allowed users to share inspirational messages on a board accessible by multiple users.
- Led the backend development using Python and Flask, ensuring efficient data management and seamless integration with the frontend. Developed and maintained server-side logic while adhering to industry best practices and standards.
- Implemented test-driven development (TDD) with Pytest and fixtures to rigorously validate the creation and retrieval routes for boards and cards, ensuring the application's robustness and reliability.
### Task-List-API : **[Back End ](https://github.com/niloofar62/task-list-api)**
- #### Tech stack : Flask, SQL, Python, GitHub, Slack API
- This project involved developing a web API with Python and Flask to manage goals and tasks, allowing users to create, update, sort, and complete tasks. It features Slack integration for feedback and organizes tasks under goals using a one-to-many model. The project utilized RESTful routes, Postman for testing, Git for version control, and incorporated external APIs, all while applying the client-server model and test-driven development with Pytest.
